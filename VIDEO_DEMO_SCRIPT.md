### üé¨ PART 4: AI Agent Demo (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Code editor - create new file `demo-agent.ts`]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's create an autonomous agent with AI capabilities. I'll use Ollama for free local AI - no API costs!"

**[Start typing code - use snippets to speed up]**

```typescript
import { SomniaAgentKit, Agent, OllamaAdapter } from 'somnia-agent-kit';

// Initialize SDK
const kit = new SomniaAgentKit();
await kit.initialize();

console.log('‚úÖ Connected to Somnia Testnet');
```

**Voiceover:**
> "First, we initialize the SDK and connect to Somnia."

**[Continue typing]**

```typescript
// Create AI-powered agent
const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Trading Bot',
  description: 'Analyzes market data and suggests trades',
  capabilities: ['analyze', 'trade', 'monitor'],
  
  // Use local LLM - FREE!
  llm: new OllamaAdapter({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434',
    model: 'llama3.2'
  }),
  
  // Run every minute
  triggers: [{
    type: 'interval',
    config: { interval: 60000 }
  }],
  
  // Enable memory for context
  memory: { enabled: true, maxSize: 1000 }
});

console.log('‚úÖ Agent created');
```

**Voiceover:**
> "We configure the agent with a local LLM model, set it to run every minute, and enable memory for maintaining context."

**[Continue typing]**

```typescript
// Define what the agent should do
agent.on('trigger', async (context) => {
  console.log('ü§ñ Agent triggered at', new Date().toISOString());
  
  // Agent analyzes market data
  const analysis = await agent.think(
    'Analyze current ETH/USD market conditions and suggest action'
  );
  
  console.log('üí≠ Agent analysis:', analysis);
  
  // Agent can execute actions based on analysis
  if (analysis.includes('buy')) {
    console.log('üìà Agent suggests: BUY');
  } else if (analysis.includes('sell')) {
    console.log('üìâ Agent suggests: SELL');
  } else {
    console.log('‚è∏Ô∏è  Agent suggests: HOLD');
  }
});

// Start the agent
await agent.start();
console.log('üöÄ Agent is now running autonomously!');
```

**Voiceover:**
> "We define the agent's behavior - it will analyze market conditions using AI and suggest trading actions. Now let's run it!"

**[Screen: Terminal]**

**Type:**
```bash
npx ts-node demo-agent.ts
```

**[Show output]**

```
‚úÖ Connected to Somnia Testnet
‚úÖ Agent created
üöÄ Agent is now running autonomously!

ü§ñ Agent triggered at 2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z

üìà Agent suggests: BUY

ü§ñ Agent triggered at 2025-01-15T10:31:00.000Z
üí≠ Agent analysis: Market consolidating, waiting for breakout confirmation. Suggest hold position.
‚è∏Ô∏è  Agent suggests: HOLD
```

**Voiceover:**
> "Amazing! The agent is now running autonomously, analyzing market data every minute using local AI, and making trading suggestions - all for free!"

**[Let it run for 2-3 triggers]**

**Voiceover:**
> "And this is just the beginning. The agent can also execute on-chain transactions, manage funds through the AgentVault, and track all activities with built-in monitoring."

## üé• Production Tips

### Recording Setup

**Screen Recording:**
- Use OBS Studio or QuickTime (Mac)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- Frame rate: 30 fps
- Hide desktop icons and notifications

**Terminal Setup:**
```bash
# Increase font size for readability
# Use clean theme (e.g., Dracula, Nord)
# Clear history before recording
clear && history -c
```

**Code Editor Setup:**
- Use VS Code with clean theme
- Font size: 16-18pt
- Hide sidebar/minimap
- Enable Prettier for auto-formatting

### Editing

**Speed Up:**
- Installation processes (2x speed)
- Typing code (use snippets, then speed up to 1.5x)
- Waiting for transactions (cut or 2x speed)

**Keep Normal Speed:**
- Voiceover explanations
- Key moments (agent registration, first trigger)
- Final output display

**Add:**
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Text overlays for key points
- Background music (subtle, low volume)
- Captions/subtitles

### Voiceover

**Tips:**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Pause between sections
- Show enthusiasm (this is cool tech!)
