# ðŸ“š Glossary

Comprehensive glossary of terms used in Somnia AI documentation.

## A

**Agent**
: An autonomous AI entity registered on the blockchain that can execute tasks, interact with users, and manage resources.

**Agent ID**
: Unique identifier assigned to each agent when registered on-chain. Used to reference the agent in all operations.

**AgentRegistry**
: Smart contract that manages agent registration, metadata, and discovery on the blockchain.

**AgentExecutor**
: Smart contract responsible for executing agent tasks with proper authorization and gas management.

**AgentVault**
: Smart contract that manages funds for agents, including deposits, withdrawals, and spending limits.

**AgentManager**
: Legacy smart contract for task queue and payment escrow management.

**API Key**
: Authentication credential required to access LLM provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

## B

**Blockchain**
: Decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers. Somnia AI uses blockchain to store agent metadata and execution history.

**Block Explorer**
: Web interface for viewing blockchain transactions, blocks, and addresses. Used for debugging and verification.

## C

**Capability**
: A skill or function that an agent can perform (e.g., "chat", "trading", "analysis").

**Completion Tokens**
: Tokens generated by the LLM in its response. More expensive than prompt tokens.

**Contract Address**
: Unique identifier for a smart contract on the blockchain.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
: Security mechanism that controls which domains can access your API.

## D

**Daily Limit**
: Maximum amount an agent can spend from its vault in a 24-hour period. Resets automatically.

**Decentralized**
: System architecture where control is distributed across multiple nodes rather than centralized in one location.

**DeepSeek**
: AI model provider offering competitive alternatives to OpenAI and Anthropic.

## E

**ERC20**
: Standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

**Ethers.js**
: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

**EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**
: Runtime environment for executing smart contracts on Ethereum and compatible chains.

## F

**Faucet**
: Service that provides free testnet tokens for development and testing.

**Finality**
: Point at which a blockchain transaction is considered irreversible.

## G

**Gas**
: Fee required to execute transactions on the blockchain. Paid in native tokens (e.g., STM on Somnia).

**Gas Limit**
: Maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a transaction.

**Gas Price**
: Amount you're willing to pay per unit of gas.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
: Type of large language model developed by OpenAI.

## H

**Hardhat**
: Development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, including compilation, testing, and deployment tools.

**Hash**
: Fixed-size string generated from input data. Used for transaction IDs and content addressing.

## I

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**
: Decentralized storage network for storing and sharing files. Used for agent metadata.

**Inference**
: Process of running an AI model to generate predictions or responses.

## K

**Key Management**
: Practices and tools for securely storing and handling private keys.

## L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
: AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

**LLM Provider**
: Service that offers access to LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek).

## M

**Mainnet**
: Production blockchain network where real value transactions occur.

**Metadata**
: Descriptive information about an agent stored on IPFS and referenced on-chain.

**Metrics**
: Quantitative measurements of agent performance and behavior.

**Monitoring**
: Continuous observation of agent health, performance, and resource usage.

## N

**NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**
: Unique digital asset on the blockchain. Agents could potentially be represented as NFTs.

**Node**
: Computer that participates in a blockchain network by validating and relaying transactions.

**Nonce**
: Number used once in blockchain transactions to prevent replay attacks and ensure transaction ordering.

## O

**Ollama**
: Tool for running large language models locally on your machine.

**On-chain**
: Data or operations stored/executed directly on the blockchain.

**Off-chain**
: Data or operations that occur outside the blockchain but may reference on-chain data.

**OpenAI**
: AI research company that created GPT models and provides API access.

## P

**PM2**
: Production process manager for Node.js applications with load balancing and monitoring.

**Private Key**
: Secret cryptographic key that controls a blockchain address. Must be kept secure.

**Prompt**
: Input text sent to an LLM to generate a response.

**Prompt Tokens**
: Tokens in the input sent to the LLM. Cheaper than completion tokens.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
: Technique to control the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.

**Registry**
: See AgentRegistry.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
: Protocol for communicating with blockchain nodes.

**RPC URL**
: Endpoint URL for connecting to a blockchain network.

## S

**SDK (Software Development Kit)**
: Collection of tools, libraries, and documentation for building applications. Somnia AI SDK simplifies agent development.

**Smart Contract**
: Self-executing code deployed on the blockchain that runs when predetermined conditions are met.

**Solidity**
: Programming language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

**Somnia**
: High-performance blockchain network optimized for real-time applications and AI agents.

**STM**
: Native token of the Somnia blockchain, used for gas fees and transactions.

**System Prompt**
: Initial instruction given to an LLM that defines its behavior and personality.

## T

**Testnet**
: Test blockchain network where developers can experiment without using real value.

**Token (Blockchain)**
: Digital asset on a blockchain (e.g., STM, USDC).

**Token (LLM)**
: Unit of text processed by an LLM. Roughly equivalent to 4 characters or 0.75 words.

**Transaction**
: Operation recorded on the blockchain, such as transferring tokens or calling a smart contract.

**Transaction Hash (TxHash)**
: Unique identifier for a blockchain transaction.

**TypeScript**
: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## V

**Vault**
: See AgentVault.

**Verification**
: Process of publishing smart contract source code on a block explorer for transparency.

## W

**Wallet**
: Software or hardware that stores private keys and allows interaction with the blockchain.

**Wei**
: Smallest unit of cryptocurrency on Ethereum and EVM chains. 1 ETH = 10^18 wei.

## Z

**Zero-downtime Deployment**
: Deployment strategy that updates an application without service interruption.
